### Last Updated: June 2023 ; first written August 2022
### R version 4.3.0

### DESCRIPTION:
## This script creates taxon richness maps at the country level (section 1) 
#   and the state level (section 2). It could also be developed to create 
#   taxon richness maps using other boundaries such as counties, ecoregions, 
#   Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) areas, 
#   etc. The maps can also be edited to fit the formatting you would like...
#   color, border weight, background tiles, etc.

### INPUTS:
## target_taxa_with_synonyms.csv
#   If you ran 1-get_taxa_metdata.R and would like to map at the country level,
#   you can use the target_taxa_with_synonyms.csv file
## occurrence point data
#   If you're mapping at the state level, the script currently reads in 
#   occurrence point data from 7-filter_occurrence_points.R 
#   (taxon_points_final folder) to determine the number of taxa in each state;
#   but you could also use occurrence points in a different format and edit 
#   the code a little.
## (optional) geopolitical boundaries shapefile(s)
#   Currently this script use country and state features from the rnaturalearth 
#   package. But, if you would like to use other boundaries, you'll need to 
#   have them as inputs.

### OUTPUTS:
## taxon_richness_maps (folder)
#   If you run section 1: 
#     Country-level taxon richness maps (HTML) for:
#     - all taxa: country-level_taxon_richness_ALL.html
#     - threatened taxa: country-level_taxon_richness_THREATENED.html
#     - endemic taxa: country-level_taxon_richness_ENDEMIC.html
#     [if there are no taxa in one of these subset, that map is skipped]
#   If you run section 2: 
#     State-level taxon richness maps (HTML), one for each country that has 
#     your target taxa (e.g. state-level_taxon_richness_Mexico.html)
